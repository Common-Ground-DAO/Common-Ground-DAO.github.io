Okay, let's analyze the relationship between your Jekyll templates and CSS files. Here's a detailed assessment based on your codebase:

## CSS and Template Integration Analysis

After reviewing the CSS files in `assets/css/` and the templates in `_layouts/` and `_includes/`, here's a detailed analysis addressing your questions:

**1. CSS Class Mismatches (CSS Classes Defined vs. Template Usage):**

*   **General Good Alignment:** For the most part, CSS classes defined in your CSS files are used in the templates. The codebase shows a conscious effort to use classes for styling elements.

*   **Potential Mismatches & Areas for Review:**
    *   **`templates.css` and `layout.css` Overlap:** As noted in the previous analysis, styles for layout elements (like `header`, `footer`, `.container`, `.hero`, `.content-container`, `.grid`) are spread across `layout.css` and `templates.css`. This separation is blurred, and some classes might be defined in one but used in templates expecting them to be in the other. **Action:** Consolidate layout-related classes in `layout.css` and template-specific styles (if any remain after refactoring) in `templates.css`.
    *   **`main.css` and `components.css` Overlap:** Similarly, some component-like styles (e.g., `.card`, `.button`) are defined in `main.css` instead of `components.css`. This creates inconsistency. **Action:** Move component-specific styles to `components.css` for better organization.
    *   **Wiki and Treasury Specific CSS:**  Styles in `wiki-components.css` and `treasury-v2.css` are generally used within their respective templates (`_includes/wiki_*`, `_includes/treasury_*` and `_layouts/wiki.html`, `_layouts/treasury.html`). However, it's worth double-checking for any unused classes within these files to ensure they are all actively applied. **Action:** Review `wiki-components.css` and `treasury-v2.css` for unused classes and verify all defined classes are used in the related templates.
    *   **Dynamic Classes in JavaScript:** JavaScript files like `mobile-nav.js`, `wiki-preview.js`, and `treasury-v2.js` may dynamically add or remove classes. Ensure these classes are actually defined in your CSS files. **Action:** Review JavaScript files and confirm that dynamically added/removed classes have corresponding CSS definitions in your stylesheets.

**2. Duplicate Style Definitions:**

*   **Identified Duplicates:**
    *   **`.card` and `.grid` styles:**  As mentioned, styles for `.card` and `.grid` are defined in both `main.css` and potentially in template-specific CSS (like `wiki.css`, `treasury-v2.css`).  This is a clear duplication.
    *   **Typography Styles:** There might be some duplication of basic typography styles (headings, paragraphs, lists) across `base.css`, `templates.css`, and potentially other CSS files. For instance, heading styles are present in `main.css` and `templates.css`.
    *   **Layout Structures:** Some basic layout structures, like containers or grid systems, might be partially redefined in different CSS files.

*   **Consolidation Needed:**
    *   **Action:**  Aggressively consolidate duplicate styles. Define `.card` and `.grid` styles (and other reusable component styles) *only* in `components.css`. Ensure base typography styles are *only* in `base.css`. Layout structures should be primarily in `layout.css`. Remove redundant definitions from `main.css`, `templates.css`, and other CSS files.
    *   **Action:** Use CSS variables extensively for colors, fonts, spacing, and sizes. This helps in maintaining consistency and reduces the need to repeat style values across different CSS files.  If you're not already, adopt CSS variables for breakpoints as well.

**3. Style Organization Matching Template Structure:**

*   **Partially Matches, Room for Improvement:** The CSS structure *attempts* to match the template structure, but there's room for improvement to make it more aligned and maintainable:
    *   `layout.css`:  Generally aligns with layout templates (`_layouts/*`).
    *   `components.css`: Aims to align with reusable includes and components (`_includes/*`).
    *   `templates.css`:  Intended to be template-specific, but currently overlaps with layout and component styles.
    *   `wiki.css`, `wiki-components.css`: Wiki-specific styles are somewhat modularized, but the separation could be clearer.
    *   `treasury-v2.css`: Treasury-specific styles are in a separate file, which is good, but could be further broken down into component-specific files if needed.

*   **Recommendations for Better Organization:**
    *   **Strict Component-Based CSS:**  For every reusable component in `_includes/`, consider creating a corresponding CSS file in `assets/css/components/` (e.g., `_includes/wiki_search.html` could have `assets/css/components/wiki-search.css`). Import these component-specific CSS files into `main.css` or the relevant layout files (like `wiki.css` or `treasury-v2.css`).
    *   **Layout-Specific CSS Files:**  For each main layout in `_layouts/`, consider having a corresponding CSS file (e.g., `_layouts/wiki.html` could have `assets/css/wiki.css`). This file would primarily handle the layout of that specific page type and import component CSS files as needed.
    *   **Clearer `templates.css` Role:**  If `templates.css` is kept, clearly define its purpose (e.g., only for very high-level, site-wide template styling that doesn't fit in layout or components). However, it might be cleaner to distribute its current styles to `layout.css` and `base.css` and potentially remove `templates.css` altogether.

**4. Unused CSS Classes or Missing Styles:**

*   **Unused CSS Classes:**  It's likely there are unused CSS classes, especially with ongoing development and refactoring. Tools like PurgeCSS (in a production build process) can help identify and remove unused CSS, but a manual review is also beneficial. **Action:** Implement PurgeCSS or a similar tool in your build process to automatically remove unused CSS. Also, periodically manually review CSS files to identify and remove unused classes.

*   **Missing Styles:**
    *   It's difficult to definitively say if there are "missing" styles without a full visual audit of the website against design specifications. However, during development, you might encounter elements that are unstyled or inconsistently styled.
    *   **Action:**  As you work on the website, pay attention to elements that appear unstyled or inconsistently styled. Create or update CSS rules in the appropriate CSS files to address these missing styles. Use browser developer tools to inspect elements and identify which styles are being applied (or not applied).

**Summary of Actions:**

1.  **Refactor `templates.css`:** Move core layout and generic typography styles to `layout.css` and `base.css` respectively. Reserve `templates.css` for truly template-specific styles or consider removing it.
2.  **Consolidate Component Styles:** Move component styles (like `.card`, `.grid`, `.button`, navigation elements, search inputs, list items) to `components.css`.
3.  **Centralize Media Queries:** Define breakpoints as CSS variables in `:root` in `base.css` and reuse them across all CSS files. Consider using Sass mixins for media queries.
4.  **Eliminate Inline Styles:** Move all `<style>` tags from HTML templates and JavaScript files to external CSS files.
5.  **Implement Stylelint:** Integrate Stylelint into your build process.
6.  **Review and Remove Unused CSS:** Implement PurgeCSS and perform manual CSS reviews for unused classes.
7.  **Component-Based CSS Files:** Create component-specific CSS files in `assets/css/components/` for reusable includes.
8.  **Layout-Specific CSS Files:** Consider layout-specific CSS files (e.g., `assets/css/wiki.css`, `assets/css/treasury.css`).
9.  **Thorough Visual Testing:** Regularly test the website visually to identify and address any inconsistencies or missing styles.

By taking these steps, you can create a more modular, maintainable, and consistent CSS structure that aligns well with your Jekyll template organization. This will make future development and styling updates significantly easier.

Okay, let's analyze the Jekyll templates, includes, and layouts. Here's an assessment based on the provided files, focusing on consistency, duplication, maintainability, and recommendations for improvements:

## Jekyll Templates, Includes, and Layouts Assessment

**1. Base Layout (`_layouts/base.html`): Good Foundation**

*   **Positive:**
    *   Sets up the basic HTML structure (`<!DOCTYPE html>`, `html`, `head`, `body`).
    *   Includes essential meta tags for character set, viewport, and title.
    *   Includes `head.html` (not provided, but assumed to contain meta and link tags).
    *   Includes `header.html` and `footer.html` for consistent site-wide elements.
    *   Defines the `<main>` content area, which is standard practice for semantic HTML.
    *   Includes a `main.js` script at the end of the `body`, suggesting proper separation of JavaScript.
    *   Provides a solid, minimal base structure that other layouts can extend.

*   **Potential Improvements:**
    *   Consider adding `lang="en"` attribute to the `<html>` tag for accessibility.
    *   The `<link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/css/main.css">` is hardcoded. While `main.css` is the main entry point, consider making this more dynamic if there's a possibility of using different stylesheets for different layouts or sections (though this might be overkill for this project).

**2. Default Layout (`_layouts/default.html`): Simple and Effective**

*   **Positive:**
    *   Extends `base.html` using `layout: base`, which is the correct way to inherit the base structure.
    *   Includes `{{ content }}` to inject page-specific content, as expected.
    *   Provides a clean and straightforward default layout for general pages.

*   **Potential Improvements:**
    *   None major. It's intentionally simple and serves its purpose well.

**3. Home Layout (`_layouts/home.html`): Building on Default**

*   **Positive:**
    *   Extends `default.html`, inheriting from the base structure and default page layout.
    *   Wraps content in `content-container` and `content` divs, suggesting consistent content styling.
    *   Includes a section for "Latest Updates" with a post list, which is specific to the homepage.

*   **Potential Improvements:**
    *   The "Latest Updates" section is hardcoded into the `home.html` layout. Consider making this a reusable include (`_includes/home_updates.html`) for better modularity, in case you want to display updates on other pages or in different formats.

**4. Page Layout (`_layouts/page.html`): Consistent Page Structure**

*   **Positive:**
    *   Extends `default.html`, maintaining consistency.
    *   Uses `content-container` and `content` divs for content, similar to `home.html`.

*   **Potential Improvements:**
    *   None major. It's a good, simple layout for general content pages.

**5. Stakeholder Layout (`_layouts/stakeholder.html`): Specific Layout for Stakeholder Pages**

*   **Positive:**
    *   Extends `default.html`, keeping the base layout consistent.
    *   Has a distinct `stakeholder-emoji` in the title, which is a nice visual touch.
    *   Includes specific sections for stakeholder information (role, location, expertise, bio, representatives, social links, CTA).

*   **Potential Improvements:**
    *   The layout is quite specific to stakeholder pages. If there are more page types with similar structured data display, consider creating more generic, reusable components (e.g., a "data card" or "profile card" include) that can be parameterized for different types of data.

**6. Treasury Layout (`_layouts/treasury.html`):  Dashboard-Style Layout**

*   **Positive:**
    *   Extends `default.html`, maintaining base structure.
    *   Implements a two-column layout using CSS Grid (`treasury-container`, `treasury-sidebar`, `treasury-content`), which is appropriate for a dashboard-style page.
    *   Includes `treasury_sidebar.html` and `treasury_search.html`, modularizing treasury-specific elements.

*   **Potential Improvements:**
    *   The two-column structure is hardcoded into the layout. Consider making the sidebar optional or more dynamically controlled (e.g., through frontmatter variables) if there's a need for treasury pages without a sidebar.

**7. Wiki Layout (`_layouts/wiki.html`): Wiki Article Layout**

*   **Positive:**
    *   Extends `default.html`, good consistency.
    *   Implements a two-column layout using CSS Grid (`wiki-container`, `wiki-sidebar`, `wiki-content`), similar to `treasury.html` but for wiki content.
    *   Includes `wiki_sidebar.html` and `wiki_search.html`, modularizing wiki-specific elements.
    *   Handles category index pages using Liquid logic (`{% if page.is_category_index %}`) to display article lists, which is a good approach.

*   **Potential Improvements:**
    *   Similar to `treasury.html`, the two-column structure is fixed. Consider making the sidebar optional or more flexible.
    *   The conditional logic within `wiki.html` for category and tag index pages and regular wiki pages is getting a bit complex.  While Liquid templating is used, if this logic grows much more complex, it might be worth considering moving some of this logic into a Jekyll plugin or using JavaScript for more dynamic content rendering.

**8. Header Include (`_includes/header.html`): Standard Header**

*   **Positive:**
    *   Contains the site header structure, logo, navigation links, and "Join Community" button.
    *   Uses CSS classes (`logo`, `nav-links`, `join-button`) for styling, which is good.

*   **Potential Improvements:**
    *   Navigation links are hardcoded. Consider making the navigation links data-driven, perhaps from a data file or frontmatter, to make it easier to update and manage the navigation menu.

**9. Footer Include (`_includes/footer.html`): Standard Footer**

*   **Positive:**
    *   Contains the site footer structure, logo, DAO info, resources, and social links.
    *   Uses CSS classes (`footer-logo`, `footer-links`, `social-links`) for styling.

*   **Potential Improvements:**
    *   Similar to the header, the footer links could be data-driven for easier management.

**General Recommendations for Improvements:**

1.  **Enhance Base Layout (`_layouts/base.html`):**
    *   Add `lang="en"` to `<html>`.
    *   Consider making the stylesheet link dynamic if needed in the future.

2.  **Modularize Homepage Updates:**
    *   Move the "Latest Updates" section in `_layouts/home.html` to a reusable include (`_includes/home_updates.html`).

3.  **Generic Components:**
    *   Create more generic, parameterized includes for reusable UI patterns:
        *   `_includes/search.html`: A single search component with placeholder and functionality variations.
        *   `_includes/breadcrumbs.html`: A single breadcrumb component with dynamic path generation.
        *   `_includes/data_card.html` or `_includes/profile_card.html`: A generic card component for displaying structured data, which could be used for stakeholders, wiki articles, etc.

4.  **Template Logic Review:**
    *   Simplify conditional logic in `_layouts/wiki.html` if it becomes more complex. Consider Jekyll plugins or JavaScript for dynamic rendering if needed.

5.  **Data-Driven Navigation and Footer Links:**
    *   Make header and footer navigation links data-driven for easier updates. Use Jekyll data files (`_data`) or frontmatter to define navigation items.

6.  **Mobile Responsiveness Focus:**
    *   Make sidebars in `treasury.html` and `wiki.html` more mobile-friendly (collapsible or alternative navigation).

7.  **Accessibility Focus:**
    *   Review all templates for accessibility and implement ARIA attributes, semantic HTML, and color contrast improvements.

By implementing these improvements, the Jekyll template structure will become more modular, consistent, maintainable, and easier to extend in the future. This will also improve the overall user experience, especially on mobile devices. Remember to address the quick wins first and then tackle the more substantial roadmap items incrementally.

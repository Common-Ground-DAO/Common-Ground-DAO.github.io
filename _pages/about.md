## Our Vision

Common Ground DAO is building the next generation of coordination tools across chats, calls, forums, and ecosystems. We believe the new web needs new ways of doing things, and we're here to make that happen. Our platform serves as the coordination layer for web3, enabling communities to connect, collaborate, and create in ways previously impossible.

## Our Values

### ‚òØÔ∏è Grounded Acceleration (g/acc)
We champion communities working together to harness technology for collective benefit. Our approach ensures technological advancement serves everyone, not just a select few. We believe in progress that lifts all boats.

### üõ°Ô∏è Defensive Acceleration (d/acc)
We're committed to developing technologies that act as safeguards, ensuring equitable progress distribution. Our focus is on decentralization, resilience, and building systems inherently resistant to coercion, monopolization, or exploitation.

### üîó Integrated Acceleration (i/acc)
While embracing decentralization, we believe in maintaining connections with broader societal frameworks. This integration enables resource and knowledge sharing, leading to more resilient and adaptive communities.

## Join Our Mission

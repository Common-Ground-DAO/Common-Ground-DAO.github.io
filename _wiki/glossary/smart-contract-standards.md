# Smart Contract Standards

Smart Contract Standards define the common protocols and interfaces that enable secure, interoperable, and consistent functionality across blockchain ecosystems and applications.

## Core Standards

1. **Wallet Standards**
   - Multisig implementations
   - Account abstraction
   - Recovery mechanisms
   - Access controls

2. **Governance Standards**
   - Voting systems
   - Proposal mechanisms
   - Execution frameworks
   - Role management

3. **Token Standards**
   - Fungible tokens
   - Non-fungible tokens
   - Semi-fungible tokens
   - Token interfaces

## Implementation

1. **Technical Specifications**
   - Interface definitions
   - Function signatures
   - Event specifications
   - State management

2. **Security Features**
   - Access control
   - Permission systems
   - Validation checks
   - Safety mechanisms

3. **Integration Points**
   - Protocol compatibility
   - Standard interfaces
   - Extension patterns
   - Upgrade paths

## Applications

1. **Community Infrastructure**
   - Governance systems
   - Treasury management
   - Role assignment
   - Resource control

2. **Protocol Development**
   - Standard compliance
   - Feature implementation
   - Security patterns
   - Integration methods

3. **Ecosystem Growth**
   - Interoperability
   - Composability
   - Innovation
   - Adoption

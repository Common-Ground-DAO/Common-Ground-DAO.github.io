# Intent Origination

Intent Origination represents the future of crypto UX, focusing on how users discover, create, and express their transaction intentions before execution.

## Core Components

1. **Discovery Mechanisms**
   - User intent identification
   - Context awareness
   - Pattern recognition
   - Opportunity discovery

2. **Creation Tools**
   - Intent formulation
   - Parameter specification
   - Constraint definition
   - Outcome optimization

3. **Curation Systems**
   - Intent validation
   - Quality assessment
   - Solver matching
   - Execution optimization

## Implementation

1. **Technical Infrastructure**
   - Chain abstraction
   - Account abstraction
   - TEE integration
   - Protocol compatibility

2. **User Experience**
   - Intent expression
   - Parameter selection
   - Outcome specification
   - Solver choice

3. **Platform Integration**
   - Discovery tools
   - Creation interfaces
   - Curation mechanisms
   - Execution pathways

## Applications

1. **Transaction Design**
   - Intent specification
   - Parameter optimization
   - Outcome definition
   - Execution planning

2. **User Interaction**
   - Intent discovery
   - Creation tools
   - Curation interfaces
   - Solver selection

3. **Platform Development**
   - Tool integration
   - Interface design
   - Protocol compatibility
   - Solver coordination

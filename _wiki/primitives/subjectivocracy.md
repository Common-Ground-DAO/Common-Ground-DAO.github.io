# Subjectivocracy

Subjectivocracy represents a novel approach to governance and decision-making that strategically incorporates subjective human judgment to complement and enhance objective systems.

## Core Concepts

1. **Subjective Decision-Making**
   - Human judgment
   - Context awareness
   - Value consideration
   - Adaptive reasoning

2. **System Boundaries**
   - Interface definition
   - Integration points
   - Transition zones
   - Interaction models

3. **Resilience Enhancement**
   - Vulnerability mitigation
   - Adaptability increase
   - System flexibility
   - Error correction

## Applications

1. **Oracle Systems**
   - Data validation
   - Truth verification
   - Context interpretation
   - Value judgment

2. **Dispute Resolution**
   - Conflict mediation
   - Solution finding
   - Fairness assessment
   - Context consideration

3. **Work Evaluation**
   - Quality assessment
   - Value determination
   - Impact measurement
   - Contribution rating

## Implementation

1. **Framework Design**
   - Decision boundaries
   - Integration points
   - Process flows
   - Feedback loops

2. **Governance Mechanisms**
   - Decision protocols
   - Voting systems
   - Consensus building
   - Dispute handling

3. **System Integration**
   - Objective interfaces
   - Subjective inputs
   - Process coordination
   - Outcome validation

## Benefits

1. **System Enhancement**
   - Flexibility increase
   - Adaptability improvement
   - Resilience building
   - Error reduction

2. **Decision Quality**
   - Context consideration
   - Value alignment
   - Fairness improvement
   - Outcome optimization

3. **Community Impact**
   - Trust building
   - Participation increase
   - Engagement enhancement
   - Satisfaction improvement

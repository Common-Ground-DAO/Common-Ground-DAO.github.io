# Discourse Graphs

Discourse Graphs provide a structured approach to mapping and analyzing conversations and viewpoints across decentralized communities. They enable collective sensemaking and coordinated problem-solving through standardized data structures.

## Core Concepts

1. **Structured Mapping**
   - Conversation tracking
   - Viewpoint identification
   - Relationship mapping
   - Pattern recognition

2. **Sensemaking Tools**
   - Convergence analysis
   - Divergence tracking
   - Consensus building
   - Knowledge synthesis

3. **Coordination Framework**
   - Cross-community dialogue
   - Viewpoint alignment
   - Action coordination
   - Resource allocation

## Technical Implementation

1. **Data Structure**
   - Graph schema
   - Node types
   - Edge relationships
   - Metadata framework

2. **Analysis Tools**
   - Pattern detection
   - Sentiment analysis
   - Consensus tracking
   - Impact measurement

3. **Integration Layer**
   - Community systems
   - Communication tools
   - Knowledge bases
   - Decision frameworks

## Applications

1. **Community Coordination**
   - Discussion mapping
   - Decision tracking
   - Consensus building
   - Action planning

2. **Knowledge Management**
   - Information organization
   - Context preservation
   - Relationship mapping
   - Knowledge discovery

3. **Problem Solving**
   - Issue identification
   - Solution development
   - Impact assessment
   - Implementation tracking

## Features

1. **Visualization**
   - Graph rendering
   - Relationship display
   - Pattern highlighting
   - Interactive exploration

2. **Analysis Tools**
   - Trend detection
   - Sentiment tracking
   - Influence mapping
   - Impact assessment

3. **Integration Points**
   - Community platforms
   - Knowledge bases
   - Decision systems
   - Action frameworks

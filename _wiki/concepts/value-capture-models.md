# Value Capture Models

The Degen/Regen duality represents web3's answer to capitalism's innovation/distribution paradox. Our Spark tokenomics demonstrate a Hamiltonian synthesis: speculative liquidity pools fund protocol R&D (Degen), while algorithmically stabilized CG Dollars redistribute yield to public goods (Regen).

The innovation lies in time-wrapped value flows:
- Degen assets ($CG Blue) have linear vesting schedules
- Regen assets ($CG Red) follow inverse decay curves
- Protocol fees auto-convert between pools based on velocity metrics

This creates a self-balancing ecosystem where short-term speculation funds long-term infrastructure, while community contributions earn non-dilutive equity. The model draws inspiration from quadratic funding but adds temporal dimensions - recognizing that value creation and capture exist on different time horizons.

The next frontier involves AI-curated bonding curves that dynamically adjust parameters based on:
1) Community health metrics (participation entropy)
2) Market depth analysis (liquidity fractals)
3) Public goods ROI (impact derivatives)

## Core Mechanics

1. **Degen Value Capture**
   - Market making
   - Yield farming
   - Trading incentives
   - Liquidity provision
   - Short-term rewards

2. **Regen Value Redistribution**
   - Public goods funding
   - Impact investing
   - Community rewards
   - Sustainable development
   - Long-term alignment

3. **Hybrid Approaches**
   - Balanced incentives
   - Dual token systems
   - Adaptive mechanisms
   - Value cycling
   - Feedback loops

## Implementation Strategies

The implementation of value capture models involves:

### 1. Market Mechanisms

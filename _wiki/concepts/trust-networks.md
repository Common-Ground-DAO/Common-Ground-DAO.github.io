# Trust Networks

Trust networks in web3 solve the Byzantine Generals Problem through economic topology. Our analysis reveals three trust geometries:

1) **Star Networks**: Centralized around protocol founders (high efficiency, low resilience)
2) **Mesh Networks**: Distributed peer-to-peer trust (high resilience, low coordination)
3) **Small-World Networks**: Optimized clusters with bridging nodes (balanced efficiency/resilience)

The CG reputation system implements small-world dynamics through:
- Local trust clusters (community-specific reputation)
- Bridging oracles (cross-community hypercerts)
- Adaptive decay rates (activity-sensitive trust metrics)

This creates a "trust L2" where local interactions scale globally without centralization. The breakthrough lies in zkReputation proofs - users can verify trust scores without exposing individual interactions, preserving privacy while enabling sybil resistance.

Future systems may employ neural trust models where AI agents predict reliability based on behavioral patterns, creating dynamic trust markets that price risk in real-time.

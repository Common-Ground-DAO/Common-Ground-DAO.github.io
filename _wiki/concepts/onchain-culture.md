# Onchain Culture

Onchain culture emerges from the cryptoeconomic equivalent of Dunbar's layers - nested coordination games operating at different resolution levels:

1) **Microculture** (150 members): High-trust interactions enabled by pseudonymous reputation
2) **Mesoculture** (1500 members): Protocol-aligned incentives with quadratic voting
3) **Macroculture** (15k+): Liquid democracy guided by AI sentiment oracles

The Fuel Ecosystem's growth demonstrates mesoculture dynamics: their "contributor merit" system weights participation by both tenure (time-locked NFTs) and peer endorsement (ERC-5484). This creates emergent social norms where newcomers earn trust through verifiable contributions rather than capital alone.

The next frontier involves cultural DAOs that programmatically evolve social contracts. Imagine communities where constitutional amendments automatically trigger based on participation entropy metrics - digital nations that harden against stagnation through algorithmic checks and balances.

# Identity and Authentication

Web3 identity systems solve the Zooko's triangle paradox through cryptographic stratification. The Passport system demonstrates this via:

1) **Base Layer**: Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) as immutable root keys
2) **Attestation Layer**: ERC-735 claims with adjustable trust horizons
3) **Application Layer**: Context-aware persona switching via ERC-5560

This architecture enables pseudonymity spectra - users fluidly adjust identity resolution based on context. A developer might use a high-resolution professional identity for DAO contributions while employing disposable personas for governance voting, all anchored to a single DID.

The LUKSO integration pioneers self-sovereign recovery through social graphs: 3-of-5 trusted contacts can regenerate keys via MPC ceremonies, eliminating single points of failure. This combines the security of multisig with the fluidity of social relationships, creating identity systems that are both robust and humane.

## Core Components

1. **Identity Systems**
   - Decentralized identifiers
   - Verifiable credentials

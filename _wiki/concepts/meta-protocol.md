# Meta Protocol

The meta-protocol emerges as a Schelling point for decentralized coordination - a minimal set of rules that allow heterogeneous systems to align incentives without sacrificing sovereignty. Unlike monolithic protocols that enforce top-down standards, this orchestration layer employs mechanism design to create positive-sum games between communities.

Our implementation uses three key mechanisms:
1) Cross-protocol state proofs via zk-SNARKs
2) Liquidity-sensitive voting weights (LSVW) that balance token holdings with community participation
3) Harberger-taxed namespace markets for ecosystem slot allocation

The genius lies in negative feedback loops: protocols that extract disproportionate value see their governance influence decay exponentially, while those contributing public goods gain amplified voice. This creates an evolutionary pressure towards ecosystem symbiosis rather than parasitic relationships.

Future iterations will introduce re-staking mechanics where protocol security becomes a composable resource. Imagine communities "renting" Ethereum's validator set for critical decisions while using lighter consensus for routine operations - a hybrid model blending shared security with localized autonomy.

# Composite Primitives

Composite primitives represent the web3 equivalent of TCP/IP's layered model - modular abstractions that transform cryptographic raw materials into user-facing functionality. Their power emerges from three design constraints: atomic decomposition (any primitive can be reduced to constituent parts), interface standardization (EIP-based compatibility), and emergent properties (new capabilities arising from combinations).

The Passport system exemplifies this through its stratified architecture:
1) Base layer: ZK-SNARKs for identity proofs
2) Middleware: ERC-734 key management
3) Application layer: Social recovery via web-of-trust

This stratification enables innovation at each layer without breaking upstream functionality - much like how HTTP evolved while maintaining TCP compatibility. The implications are profound: communities can swap governance modules (Aragon-style voting vs. DAOstack holographic consensus) while maintaining shared identity and reputation layers.

## Core Characteristics

1. **Composition**
   - Atomic primitive integration
   - Standardized interfaces
   - Modular design
   - Extensible architecture

# Coordination

The coordination problem in web3 presents a multidimensional challenge spanning technical, social, and economic layers. At its core lies the tension between individual incentive alignment and collective value creation - a modern incarnation of the socialist calculation problem enhanced by cryptographic primitives.

Technical implementations must navigate the trilemma of decentralization, scalability, and security. Smart contract-based voting systems provide auditability but risk ossification, while social layer solutions like discourse graphs enable fluid deliberation at the cost of formal accountability. The economic layer introduces additional complexity through tokenized incentive design where poorly calibrated mechanisms can lead to extractive short-termism.

Emerging solutions demonstrate promising approaches: non-plutocratic governance models using proof-of-participation, retroactive public goods funding with accountability graphs, and cross-community resource pooling through vault networks. However, the field remains early-stage, with most systems failing to surpass Dunbar's number in effective coordination capacity.

The path forward likely involves hybrid architectures combining:
1) Onchain execution guarantees for high-value decisions
2) Offchain deliberation systems with zk-reputation
3) AI-mediated mechanism design that dynamically optimizes incentive parameters

# Convergence

The convergence thesis posits an inevitable gravitational pull where applications aggregate users while blockspace becomes commoditized - a natural evolution mirroring the internet's progression from protocols to platforms. This manifests through three interlocking trends: the abstraction of cryptographic complexity into passkey-enabled UX, the maturation of smart contract standards into social primitives, and the emergence of global stablecoin networks as value rails.

Implementation requires solving the onboarding trilemma: frictionless access must coexist with self-sovereign security and cross-chain interoperability. Our LUKSO integration demonstrates this through Universal Profile logins that bundle ERC-725/735 standards with gasless transactions via ERC-4337 - reducing 12-step onboarding flows to single-click experiences.

The endgame sees applications becoming mere interfaces to a unified coordination layer, where community hyperstructures compose like TCP/IP stacks. Just as HTTP abstracted networking complexities, convergence will hide blockchain's machinery behind social primitives - identity becomes reputation, transactions become interactions, and blockspace becomes ambient infrastructure.

# Cross-Chain Interoperability

Cross-chain interoperability solves the blockchain trilemma's fourth dimension: network effects. Through a combination of state proofs (using zkBridge), liquidity routing (via cross-chain AMMs), and intent propagation (ERC-7687), communities can coordinate across chains without centralized custodians.

Our Fuel Ecosystem integration demonstrates three key innovations:
1) Light client bridges using Fuel's parallel execution model
2) MEV-resistant cross-chain swaps via time-locked commitments
3) Governance message passing with optimistic verification

This creates a "network of networks" effect where value accrues to the meta-protocol rather than individual chains. The endgame resembles internet peering agreements - competitive chains cooperate on interoperability standards because the rising tide lifts all boats. Vitalik's early vision of chain-agnostic dapps becomes reality as composite primitives abstract away underlying execution environments.

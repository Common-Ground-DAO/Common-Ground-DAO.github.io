# Game of Chains

The Game of Chains framework reveals how token distribution mechanics act as DNA shaping community evolution. Through rigorous analysis of memecoin launches, DAO formations, and protocol treasuries, we observe three evolutionary patterns: 

1) **Velocity-Driven Communities** (high token velocity → rapid feature iteration)
2) **Stakeholder-Aligned Networks** (concentrated holdings → protocol ossification) 
3) **Participation-Maximized Ecosystems** (broad distribution → governance paralysis)

The $CG model introduces a fourth path: **Temporal Stake Segmentation**. By separating transient speculation ($CG Blue) from persistent stewardship ($CG Red), communities gain adaptive advantages - rapid capital formation combined with long-term orientation. This mirrors biological systems separating somatic and germ cells, enabling both immediate responsiveness and genetic continuity.

The breakthrough lies in decay curve mathematics: $CG Red's non-transferability combined with hyperbolic decay (1/(1 + kt)) creates time-binding social contracts. Participants must continually reinvest attention to maintain influence, preventing the tragedy of the commons that plagues static token models.

## Core Dynamics

1. **Competition**
   - Resource allocation
   - Market positioning
   - Value capture
   - User acquisition

2. **Cooperation**
   - Resource sharing
   - Value creation
   - Network effects
   - Protocol alignment

3. **Strategy**
   - Ecosystem selection
   - Resource deployment
   - Alliance formation
   - Value optimization

## Implementation

1. **Economic Layer**
   - Value flows
   - Token mechanics
   - Market dynamics
   - Resource allocation

2. **Social Layer**
   - Community alignment
   - Network building
   - Trust formation
   - Reputation systems

3. **Technical Layer**
   - Protocol integration
   - Cross-chain bridges
   - State management
   - Resource optimization

## Applications

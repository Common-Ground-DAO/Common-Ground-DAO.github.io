      <p class="lead mb-8">About the founders of Common Ground and why building a new, fairer social network is important for democracy.</p>

      <h2 class="heading-4 mb-4">Building the Orchestration Layer for Onchain Organizations</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">What if every human could cast a vote each day on something that's important to their local or wider community, or delegate their vote to a trusted friend or community leader?</p>

      <p class="mb-6">What if the positive impact of community work were measurable and thus, fundable?</p>

      <p class="mb-6">What if communities could build in public while filtering signal from noise effortlessly?</p>

      <p class="mb-6">As web3 natives, we know that all of these things are possible - in theory - today. What's lacking isn't even just "apps" - which is often framed as the key problem when the discussion turns to how we'll onboard the ominous "next billion users".</p>

      <p class="lead mb-8">We're lacking the guiding thread that weaves onchain primitives into a coherent whole to an end user, allowing anyone to harness the superpowers of credibly neutral, sovereign and resilient coordination infrastructure.</p>

      <h2 class="heading-4 mb-4">Communication is the atomic unit of Coordination</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">We started with a real-time web3 communications app, to serve as the integration layer on which emerging onchain primitives like smart wallets, community tokens, onchain treasuries, governance and more are woven into a coherent, impactful interaction surface.</p>

      <h2 class="heading-4 mb-4">We believe in the power of communities</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">Common Ground is designed as a user-owned cooperative, which means the platform is actually owned by its users. We embrace this model because it aligns the interests of everyone involved in making Common Ground a success and ensures that decisions are always made for the benefit of the community as a whole.</p>

      <p class="mb-6">Our primary focus is to create a platform that brings people together instead of dividing them with polarizing, algorithmic content. We are uncompromising when it comes to user privacy; in fact we collect as little data as possible about you. By leveraging cutting-edge technology, we ensure that you own your data and identity, while our unique reward system acknowledges your valuable contributions to the community.</p>

      <p class="mb-6">Being a user-owned cooperative also means that you have a say in how the platform evolves, giving you the opportunity to participate in decision-making processes and influence the future of Common Ground.</p>

      <p class="mb-6">With a dedicated team of engineers, designers, and community builders, we have created a user-friendly platform that combines the best of social networking, content sharing, and fair rewards for creators and users alike. Our innovative reward system enables you to support your favorite creators, access exclusive content, and contribute to the platform's growth.</p>

      <p class="mb-6">At the heart of Common Ground is our commitment to inclusivity, sustainability, and innovation. We continuously strive to stay ahead of the curve, developing new features and partnerships that will shape the future of social media and empower individuals around the world.</p>

      <p>Join us on this journey as we revolutionize the way people connect, create, and collaborate online. Together, let's build a brighter future for communities everywhere, on Common Ground.</p>

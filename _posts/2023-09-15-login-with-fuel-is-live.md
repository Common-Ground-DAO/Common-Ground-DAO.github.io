      <h2 class="heading-4 mb-4">Fuel Integration Part 1 is live!</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">We're thrilled to announce that the first part of our Fuel Network integration is live – You can now log in and sign up using either your Fuel or Fuelet Wallets!</p>

      <p class="mb-6">Simply visit app.cg and sign up using your Fuel wallet of choice, or add the wallet to your existing Common Ground account to add it as a login method for next time! (Desktop only for now)</p>

      <p class="mb-6">This is just the first of several steps we will take to deliver a dedicated Fuel experience on Common Ground, with support for Fuel assets such as .fuel user names and tokens coming soon.</p>

      <p class="mb-8">What makes this extra special is that Fuel is the first non-EVM Ecosystem that we are integrating. It's the first among a set of Ecosystems we want to support on Common Ground to truly become the interoperable coordination layer of Web3.</p>

      <h2 class="heading-4 mb-4">So what's it like working with Fuel?</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">We're happy to report that building the support for Fuel was well documented (doubly so after the recent rework!)</p>

      <p class="mb-8">For any dApps looking to integrate Fuel Network, here's a quote from our engineer Gabriel: "It was pretty straightforward and self-explanatory, I didn't encounter problems, it fits very well with our architecture" - if that isn't high praise we don't know what is!</p>

      <h2 class="heading-4 mb-4">Introducing the Fuel white-label</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">Finally, we're proud to announce that we will be building a dedicated white-label solution for Fuel to truly create a home for all Fuel communities – builders, collectors, speculators, and friends. A Fuel-branded front-page will feel beautifully embedded as part of the wider Ecosystem, and rally the troops under a common banner. The design and development is already in progress, and we aim to launch it still this year.</p>

      <p class="mb-6">As with our overall strategy, the Fuel white-label experience will tie deeply into the entire Common Ground platform. You'll be able to easily swap which Ecosystem you're on, chat across Ecosystems from inside chats, and find synergy and collaboration anywhere you go. It's new, blazingly innovative, and we hope you'll join us as more Ecosystems sign up for their own white-labelled Common Ground environment, creating an interconnected community superstructure.</p>

      <p class="mb-8">Fuel is among the first to support us, and it is with pride that we support this partnership and launch the first step of integrating the Fuel Network into Common Ground today.</p>

      <p>Thanks for reading and see you on Common Ground.</p>

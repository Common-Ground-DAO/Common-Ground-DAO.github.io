      <h2 class="heading-4 mb-4">What is a community platform for Web3?</h2>
      <p class="mb-8">A community platform for Web3 is a digital space where individuals can come together, share ideas, collaborate on projects, and engage in discussions. Unlike traditional platforms, Web3 communities leverage tokens to manage memberships, monetize their community, distribute royalties, gate access to chats, content and roles, and much more. Blockchain technology allows web3 communities to manage funds collectively, ensure transparency, share ownership in communal assets and vote on important issues. Common Ground brings makes all of these functionalities easy to use without any prior knowledge about web3.</p>

      <h2 class="heading-4 mb-4">What's the best community in Web3?</h2>
      <p class="mb-8">While there are many thriving communities in Web3, one standout is the Common Ground community. The Common Ground community gathers all the people who are interested in building web3 communities together.

      <p class="mb-8">You can find Web3 communities easily on the Common Ground community discovery page.

      <h2 class="heading-4 mb-4">How do I start a Web3 community?</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">In the past, starting a web3 community was hard. Web3 communities were complicated to set up, maintain and grow. Coordinating an entire web3 ecosystem was even harder. Communities were fragmented across many different tools that solved only narrow problems, such as governance, funding, token issuance, identity management, treasury management and more. In reality, even web3 communities were forced to live on web2 platforms, who didn't offer native integrations of the web3 protocols these communities relied on.</p>

      <p class="mb-6">Today, thanks to Common Ground, things are very different. To start a web3 community, you simply navigate to the Common Ground app and click on the button that says "Create a Community". You give it a name, a nice logo and - optionally - additional information about its purpose and related info and that's it: you've just created your first web3 community. Isn't that simple?</p>

      <p class="mb-4">Here are some more tips on starting a Web3 community:</p>
      <ul class="mb-8">
        <li>Identify a niche or focus area. There are many great examples for you to look at</li>
        <li>Write some articles in your community to better explain its mission & purpose</li>
        <li>Share your articles on social media to help others discover your community</li>
        <li>Engage your members through discussions, events, and collaborations</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="heading-4 mb-4">Is Facebook using Web3?</h2>
      <p class="mb-8">Facebook, now known as Meta, is a prime example of a "web2 platform". It's not web3 because you don't truly own your community when you create it on Facebook. Your community can be removed, censored, demonetized or deplatformed at will by Facebook. In web3, things are different. You truly own your community and members. Nobody can censor or deplatform you because your essential data is stored on a decentralized, distributed ledger called the blockchain. Want to learn more about this? Drop by the Common Ground community and spark a conversation.</p>

      <p class="lead mb-8">What would be a good metaphor to describe Common Ground? We all have a vision of what this platform could one day turn into. Finding a good metaphor can help other people see it already today, despite some missing features or other shortcomings.</p>

      <img src="/assets/images/blog/power-of-metaphors.webp" alt="Space station" class="mb-8">

      <p class="mb-6">I chose the image of a space station for the header of this article because that's what our friends at c-base (where we did the Radical Sovereignty Workshop in September) chose as their metaphor for the space they have been running for 20 years. To them, thinking about c-base as a space station helps everyone navigate the space and the institution managing it better.</p>

      <p class="mb-6">That doesn't mean I believe Common Ground should be likened to a space station. Quite the opposite, we may represent something much more earthly, like a Garden or, as Jan likes to do, a Plattenbau.</p>

      <p class="mb-6">Whatever it is, converging on a metaphor could become a really powerful tool in how we talk about Common Ground and how we organize ourselves on here.</p>

      <p class="lead mb-8">We're excited to announce the public launch of Common Ground - the free, open-source alternative to Discord built for communities that value ownership and privacy.</p>

      <h2 class="heading-4 mb-4">Why Common Ground?</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">Traditional chat platforms extract value from communities while offering little in return. Common Ground flips this model by giving communities true ownership over their spaces, data, and governance.</p>

      <h2 class="heading-4 mb-4">Key Features</h2>
      <ul class="mb-6">
        <li>Token-gated channels and roles</li>
        <li>On-chain governance integration</li>
        <li>Self-hosting support</li>
        <li>No ads, no tracking</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="mb-6">This is just the beginning. We're building in public and invite you to join us on this journey.</p>

      <p class="mb-6">If you want to be part of a Collective Intelligence community to find friends to connect and collaborate with, Collective Brain is the perfect spot. We are very impressed and proud of the work being developed by @carmonpa1 on Common Ground, and we want to support the growth of such a relevant community.</p>

      <p class="mb-6">Collective Brain aims to be a place for curated, quality content, covering a wide range of topics that the community members decide are interesting. With learning processes based on people, like-minded peers are able to gather, curate and share the best and most relevant content, making it easy for members to find and learn together.</p>

      <p class="mb-6">By using Collective Intelligence principles and pooling the knowledge, skills, and experiences of the group members, Collective Brain is a great example on how a community can create an environment that fosters collaboration and communication.</p>

      <p class="mb-6">The community is focused on making it easy for members to share knowledge and learn, and it fosters an environment of mutual support and encouragement. Whether you're interested in Web3, DAOs, DeFi, DeSci or any other topic, Collective Brain is a great place to learn and connect with like-minded individuals.</p>

      <p>We hope to see you there!</p>

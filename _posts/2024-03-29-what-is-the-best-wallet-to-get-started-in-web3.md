      <h2 class="heading-4 mb-4">Why Wallets?</h2>
      <p class="mb-8">Wallets are software to securely manage your crypto assets & onchain identities. On Common Ground wallets are crucial to create token-gated spaces in your community or to access token-gated spaces respectively.</p>

      <h2 class="heading-4 mb-4">Enter MetaMask</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">MetaMask has been a longstanding favorite among crypto enthusiasts and it continues to innovate with new features. One of its latest additions is MetaMask Snaps, a system that allows developers to create custom functionality for MetaMask, enhancing its capabilities and allowing for more tailored user experiences. Snaps can add new APIs, support different blockchain protocols, and introduce various features that make MetaMask even more versatile.</p>

      <p class="mb-8">But a growing number of users report that they are increasingly frustrated with Metamask due to its outdated interface and inconsistent performance. Enter Rabby Wallet, a modern alternative that's quickly gaining popularity for its user-friendly design and robust features.</p>

      <h2 class="heading-4 mb-4">Key Advantages of Rabby Wallet</h2>

      <h3 class="heading-5 mb-2">1. Seamless Multi-Chain Support</h3>
      <p class="mb-6">One major drawback of MetaMask is the manual network switching required for different blockchains. Rabby Wallet solves this with seamless multi-chain support, automatically managing your networks and making transactions smoother.</p>
